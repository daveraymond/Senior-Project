# Senior-Project
Senior Project for my BS in Information Technology at Plymouth State University.

Please note: While the project reads all files as YACC filetypes, these files are specific to the YoYoGames Game Maker Studio 2 IDE. Other files inside are of type `.gml`, which should be considered as Game Maker Language.
